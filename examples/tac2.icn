# Taking more advantage of Icon's syntax and its notion of expression failure
# leads to a more concise solution:
procedure main()
    lines := []

    while push(lines, read()) # When read() fails (at EOF) the failure is
                              # propagated to push(...), which fails in turn.
                              # The failure of push() causes the 'while' to fail.

    while write(pop(lines))
end
